## Getting started

You should be able to just run

```shell
npm install
```

which will install the PureScript compiler and Spago build tool. Then

```shell
npx spago install && npx spago build
```

to download and compile the PureScript dependencies. Then run the app with

```shell
npm run start
```


**TODO:** Add instructions for global PureScript/Spago/Parcel installation
